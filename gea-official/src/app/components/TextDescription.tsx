                THE ORIGINS OF G E A

                    G E A was born as a summer dream of Alfonso Caro (guitars) and Carlos
                    Romero (guitars), who were joined by Alberto Manrique (drums). Initially
                    conceived as a project focused on studio experimentation, it evolved into
                    an opportunity to write songs out of lengthy jams.

                <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed">
                    It was during the late April of 2021 that Carlos and Alfonso started to
                    work on what would become the band’s first song:
                    <span className="font-bold text-red-500 text-2xl"> Patagonia</span>. Alberto
                    (former The Rest, Estación Púrpura) joined as the drummer. Together they
                    agreed to release music under G E A, inspired by the name of the greek
                    goddess of the same name.
                </p>
                <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed">
                    Patagonia was released in October of 2021 and the band kept rehearsing and
                    writing new compositions. 2022 saw the band releasing the 10 minute track
                    <span className="font-bold text-red-500 text-2xl"> Cold Fields</span> and
                    playing their first gigs on Seville alongside bands such as Hellhounds, Be
                    Right Back and Hell Of A Mind. The band starts 2023 with creative thirst
                    and ambition releasing the two track EP,
                    <span className="font-bold text-red-500 text-2xl"> Boris Insalubre / Late Papa - Zaratustra </span>
                    , self-produced by the band members themselves.
